              I am a Full Stack Web Developer, trained in LAMP as well as JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS.  I love the process of building web pages and software, and am eager to bring my skills and passion, as well as the strong interpersonal skills developed through seven years as a professional educator, to an organization that requires a junior web developer.
