                  <p class="exp-body">
                    I worked as the Front End Developer for <em>Main Street Power Mail</em>, a Carmel, Indiana company that sells leads to insurance companies.  I used JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3 to dynamically create an elegant, responsive front end experience.  In addition, I did back end work with MySQL using PHP and Ruby on Rails.

                <p class="exp-body">
                  I worked as a PHP Developer with <em>End Result</em>, a Carmel, Indiana company that records times and scores for marathons and bike races.  I and one other developer used PHP, MySQL, HTML5, and CSS3 to create an online race calendar where users could create races and then add events and information to them.

                  I am a graduate of <em>CodeUp</em>, a programming boot camp in San Antonio, Texas, where I was taught the full LAMP stack, as well as JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS.  Over a 12-week period, I completed over a hundred coding exercises, homework assignments, and challenges.  I also helped to develop worldmentr.org, an interactive website that allows men and women to give or receive mentoring on any subject across the web.

                <p class="exp-heading">Professional Educator - 2007 to 2014</p>
                <p class="exp-body">
                  I taught all grades 2-9 at four different schools over a period of seven years.  At two of my schools, the student body was over 95% African American, and at another school I taught exclusively special needs children.  I tailored my instruction to fit the needs of my studets, developed strong relations with students and their families, and kept detailed and organized records of student progress.
